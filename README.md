Ruler Compass
=============

Ruler and Compass is a project to create and visualize formal ruler
and compass constructions.

We try to mimick [Bret Victor][1] [inventing on principle][2] style of
programming.

Construction Language
---------------------

We are inspired by [Geometric Constructions][3] for the construction
language. Unfortunatly the rich symbolism is unavailble on most
keyboards. We will use the following alternatives:

<table>
<thead>
<tr><td>Notation</td><td>Meaning</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>A-B-C</td><td>point B is between points A and C</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>line through points A and B</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>ray with vertex A passing through B</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>segment with endpoints A and B</td></tr>
<tr><td>AB</td><td>distance from A to B</td></tr>
<tr><td>A_B</td><td>circle through B with center A</td></tr>
<tr><td>A_BC</td><td>circle with center A and radius BC</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>degree measure of the angle ABC</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>triangle with vertices A,B,C</td></tr>
<tr><td>ABC</td><td>area of triangle ?ABC</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>quadrilateral with sides ?AB, ?BC, ?CD, ?DA</td></tr>
<tr><td>ABCD</td><td>the area of ?ABCD</td></tr>
<tr><td>p=q</td><td>"p" and "q" are names for the same object</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>p is congruent to q</td></tr>
<tr><td>p~q</td><td>p is similiar to q</td></tr>
